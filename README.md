By the way i'm listening to EaglercraftX 1.8-u7 while writing this README file

==============Welcome to the backstory of R-Central==============

Thanks, ayunami2000 and lax1dude for inspiration, this inspired me to go on my journey to use github and other things. And thanks to 

R-Central is a site that lets you play games at school and at home. This was mostly used at my school because my friends and other students just wanted to play games. I made this because my school blocked almost literally everything. So I saw other kids going on these unblocked games sites, these were created from Google Sites. So I also played those. However, A site everyone always played got blocked by our Schools IT Admin. After that everyone got bored. a few weeks later, I learned how to make a site!

That's when my Journey began.

First I made a page originally Named "(My name)'s Site"
I first put Google's built in games such as Snake, Solitaire, Minesweeper and all of that
I also found other links to other sites and thought I could put those links in MY site so that my site would have all unblocked links!
When I did that I called it "The Super Site"

Then my dumb finally realized why some teachers found out that was mine.
Clearly I put my name on it.
So then I changed the name and the looks to make it like I deleted my site and acted like that was not mine.
That's when I started to put Unblocked games hub, it was good at first. I started to put more games. And then people started playing on it.
I mostly put Scratch games first but then started to put Unity and HTML5 games.
It was like I made a Game Hub.

That's when I started to upgrade it even more, trying to find other sites for people to go to. When I came across these sites.

SealCentral - B-Central - Unblocked games WTF - The Cyber City and Extreme Math

Those were the key to my success

The ones that inspired me most was SealCentral and B-Central
Thats how I got the name R-Central.
I originally got R-Central because both of these had 'Central' in them
The R stands for Replit. So the real name was Replit-Central
I started to put Replit games such as, WorldBox, Roblox, Atari Breakout, and lastly, Eaglercraft
When I put Minecraft on the site the whole thing changed.
I was testing Eaglercraft until I got in so amazed.
That's when I explored more about it. The creator was lax1dude. By that time I got introduced to ayunami2000 while exploring more about eaglercraft.
When I first saw Eaglercraft ayunami2000 had eaglercraft forked so I just assumed they were both friends and creators of the game.

I then started to put github.io games on my site like yexex and also some unblockers.
I was famous at my school for that.
Then I started to make my site look better by chaning the looks to look like SealCentral and B-Central. The games that I have were ideas from Cyber City and Extreme Math.

Also the famous unblocked game site that I mentioned firstly was Unblocked games WTF. Which also game me inspiration

==============And that's how R-Central was Made.==============
